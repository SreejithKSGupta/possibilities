# Possibilities

Possibilities is a web application built with SvelteKit. It is used to create random color combinations in n*n grids, with a possibility to get some recognizable shapes.
theoretically, it should be able to generate All low resolution images, like the image of old game charecters or even you in 100*100 resolution, but with less than 1 in a trillion chance.

## Features
- Change the number of rows and columns in the grid
- Change the bit depth of the colors ( number of colors  combinations)
- refresh rate of the image
- theoretical possibility of getting recognizable shapes
- lots of fun
